# Russian Doll Benchmarks

This benchmark follows from the examples illustrating $\exist$-step encodings discussed in 

```bibtex
@article{10.1016/j.artint.2006.08.002, 
year = {2006}, 
keywords = {Parallel Planning,Planning,SAT}, 
title = {{Planning as satisfiability: parallel plans and algorithms for plan search}}, 
author = {Rintanen, Jussi and Heljanko, Keijo and Niemel√§, Ilkka}, 
journal = {Artificial Intelligence}, 
issn = {0004-3702}, 
doi = {10.1016/j.artint.2006.08.002}, 
pages = {1031--1080}, 
number = {12-13}, 
volume = {170}
}
```

and 

```bibtex 
@incollection{rintanen:satplan
    author = {Jussi Rintanen},
    title = {Planning as Satisfiability},
    year = {2021},
    booktitle = {Handbook of Satisifiability},
    editor = {Martin van~Heule and Armin Biere},
    edition = {2nd},
